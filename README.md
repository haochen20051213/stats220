2. I am taking STATS 220 because this course is very important and essential for me. 
3. I am interested in learning about how to use r studio to study and finish my homework.
4. and i like cute animal , for example , [this cat](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/striped-with-white-a-cat-gm493372854-76860081?utm_source=pixabay&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=sponsored_photo&utm_content=srp_topbanner_media&utm_term=cute+cat)
