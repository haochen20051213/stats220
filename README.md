2. I am taking STATS 220 because this course is very important and essential for me. 
3. I am interested in learning about how to use r studio to study and finish my homework.
4. and i like cute animal , for example , [this cat](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9009530112/h6A3841C7/hey-human-you-brain-is-two-tense-two-tenths-the-size-of-a-normal-brain)

- I always play basketball after class.
- I think that playing basketball can exercis my body.
